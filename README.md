# Apartment-Condo-Listings-Data-Scraping

This project involves data scraping the site: https://www.rew.ca/. This initial motivation for this project was simple, I wanted to apply my recent knowledge of data scraping on a website that I thought to be interesting and worthwhile for me. It is a dream of mine to own a piece of real estate of my own one day but I want to be able to leverage the use of sound data analytics in order to buy the property that is undervalued. 

The first step on this journey would involve gathering data which is what this depository will be all about. Gathering the raw data (with the use if BeautifulSoup for web scraping) and then cleaning the data to make it more readable and usable (with pandas dataframes).
